This program explores different edit distance algorithms
and a spell spell checker. 

Usage:
Provide a command line argument for which function you want to run.
Below are all the possible arguments:

spellChecker_test
Run the tests on the spell checker (see function below with same name)

documentCheck_test
Run tests on documentCheck function

editDistance_test
Runs test on the edit distance functions

ex. Usage: CS375_Proj4_Code_Team_AT_CZ_EW_XM.py editDistance_test

Layout of File:
editDistance_rec
editDistance_iter
spellCheck
findSuggestions (helper function for spellCheck)
documentCheck (Opens a txt document and spell checks it)
spellCheckImproved 
make_word_dict (Opens a txt dictionary file and converts to list of words)
3 test functions for each of the main algorithms
main function which handles command line arguments and runs desired functions
